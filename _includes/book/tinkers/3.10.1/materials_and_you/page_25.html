    <p>Defense are a type of modifier exclusive to armor, boosting protection against particular threats such as fire or knockback. They provide another way to customize armor as most armor types lack material traits. </p>

<p class="title">Further Reading</p>
<p>Now that you understand the basics of tinkering, take some time to use what you learned and create a few basic tools. Once you are comfortable with the basics, you can read books from some of my colleagues covering more advanced topics.</p>
