<span style="color: #000000">Traits are inborne abilities related to the creation of the tool. They are brought out with superior quality, sympathetic magic, or by running enough energy into the tool that it starts exhibiting unusual properties.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">There are two basic types of traits: material traits which come from the materials chosen for each part in the tool, and tool traits which are native to the type of tool crafted.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">This book, along with Thruul M'Gon's Puny and Mighty Smelting and Nemea's Fantastic Foundry all cover a tier of materials with a listing of material traits. Tool traits are covered both by this book and Mighty Smelting.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Upgrades are standard improvements to a tool. They are usually done by applying an item and 'rubbing off' some of its magic qualities, like redstone making tools faster. </span>
<span style="color: #000000">Most tools start with around 3 upgrade slots, though it's possible to get more slots through other types of modifiers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Thruul M'Gon's Puny Smelting has a full list of upgrades available on tools, along with the Encyclopedia of Tinkering.</span></p>
