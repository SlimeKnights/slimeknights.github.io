<span style="color: #000000">So, you want to store your extra parts in a special chest, eh? If not, too bad you have the option anyway. </span>
<span style="color: #000000">Part chests allow you to store an abundance of extra parts you may have. Each slot can hold a stack of 8 parts max. If you need more than that, you're doing something wrong or have very convoluted recipes.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Oh, that chest is too restrictive? Try the tinkers' chest! It can store any item in a total of 64 slots, though each slot holds just 16 items.</span>
