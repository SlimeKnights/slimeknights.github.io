To repair tools, simply place the tool in the Tinker Station or Tinker Anvil with the material of the head. Alternatively, you can use repair kits, which work both in crafting tables and when right clicking the tool directly!</p>

Ever wish you could undo a past mistake? Luckily you can on tools. If you want to change the material of one of the parts, place the tool with the desired new part in the tinker station. For tools that have multiple of the same part, try a few different slots to replace the right one. For armor, you can often swap parts using a casting table.</p>
