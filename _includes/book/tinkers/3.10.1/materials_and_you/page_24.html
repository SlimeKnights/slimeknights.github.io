Slotless modifiers do not require slots, unlike all other types of modifiers. This typically means the modifier either has some tradeoff or the effect is minor. 
One notable type of slotless modifiers is bonus modifiers, which grant additional modifier slots. Many exist that grant more upgrade slots, and I am told some even exist to grant more ability slots.</p>

Abilities are powerful modifiers that drastically change a tool. Modifiers such as silky and autosmelt are notable as both change the effects of mining blocks, while dual wielding makes tools much easier to handle. 
Nearly all tools start with a single ability slot, and can only receive up to 2 more, so choose abilities wisely.</p>
