<span style="color: #000000">My Fantastic Foundry will give you byproducts from your ores. You may be asking 'But Nemea what are these byproducts?' Well just read a bit further and find out.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Byproducts are the hidden extras inside your ores that you would not normally be able to achieve with a simple furnace. A bit of extra material of some other kind that is hidden in the rock.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">A couple of examples: copper ore gives gold as a byproduct, and cobalt ore gives iron as a byproduct.</span>
