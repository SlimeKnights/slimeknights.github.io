<span style="color: #000000">Since my foundry can't alloy I have created a solution for you that is simple to use.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">
• Requires a fuel tank or a heater, better fuel allows making better alloys</span>
<span style="color: #000000">
• Takes input from tanks around the alloyer, adding more tanks gives you more metals to alloy with at once</span>
