<p>The drain is your input/output of the foundry when it comes to fluids. You can use faucets or pipes from your favorite mod on the drain to pour out fluids. Buckets, copper cans, and channels may be used on the drain to input or take out fluids.</p>
<p>The fluid shown in the middle of the drain will be the next one to pour out.</p>

<p>The scorched duct is your way to pull a specific fluid out of the foundry. The fluid is chosen by putting a copper can or bucket full of that liquid in the duct's filter slot.</p>
<p>The fluid that you have selected to be filtered will show on the middle of the duct.</p>
