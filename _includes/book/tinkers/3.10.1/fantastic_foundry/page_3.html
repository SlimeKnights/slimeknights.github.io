<p>Your basic Alloyer GUI, except there could be more or less</p>

1: This area is where you see the materials in the side tanks, more tanks equals more spots for materials.</p>
<p>2: This is the area where your alloyed materials will show once they are finished working their magic.</p>
<p>3: This area is where your fuel shows. Hotter fuels means you can melt more things.</p>
<p>In both 1 and 3, left clicking with a fluid item will attempt to fill the item from the tank, while right clicking will attempt to dump the item into the tank.</p></div>
