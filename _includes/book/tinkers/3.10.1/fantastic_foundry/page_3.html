<span style="color: #000000">1: This area is where you see the materials in the side tanks, more tanks equals more spots for materials.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">3: This area is where your fuel shows. Hotter fuels means you can melt more things.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">In both 1 and 3, left clicking with a fluid item will attempt to fill the item from the tank, while right clicking will attempt to dump the item into the tank.</span>
