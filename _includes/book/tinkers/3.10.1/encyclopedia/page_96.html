<span style="color: #000000">
• Chestplates can receive interaction abilities that are used when hands are empty. Most are covered in the interaction section.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">
• Leggings have inventory based abilities and passive boosts to the player.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">
• Boots provide movement and jump based abilities.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">
