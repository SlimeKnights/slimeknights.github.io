Armor abilities are typically effective on a single type of armor. Each type of armor has a different special attribute:</p>
<p>• Helmets can be controlled using a keybinding for special effects.

• Chestplates can receive interaction abilities that are used when hands are empty. Most are covered in the interaction section.

• Leggings have inventory based abilities and passive boosts to the player.

• Boots provide movement and jump based abilities.

• Shields are more effective at counterattacks, but some modifiers only work when blocking.</p></div>
