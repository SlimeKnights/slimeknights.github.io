During my research into tool making, I noticed several authors have created partial lists of materials but there was no one complete list. This means in order to properly compare all the materials, it is necessary to switch between several volumes. This book is intended to solve that problem by indexing known materials from several different volumes into a single book.</p>
<p>I could not have created such a grand book alone. This book also includes lists of materials collected by both Thruul M'Gon and Nemea. Just don't tell either of them that I spoke with both of them.</p></div><div class="right"><p id="focus" class="underline " style="align-self: center">Focus</p><p>
This book is focused on tool building. Unlike other volumes like Materials and You or Mighty Smelting, it won't explain how to use the technology used in tool creation; it just lists all the optionals available assuming you have the technology.</p>
<p>If you are unsure of how to use the technology or find the resources, you will need to refer to a copy of Materials and You, Puny Smelting, Mighty Smelting, Fantastic Foundry, or Tinkers' Gadgetry.</p></div>
