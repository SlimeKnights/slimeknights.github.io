Hey future or current tinker. My name is Melvin. I fell in a slimepool once, and since then I have never stopped experimenting with slime. While I am not a master tinker yet, I am hoping some of my discoveries will one day get me accepted into their ranks.</p>
<p>This book covers inventions I have made, my attempts to discover new modifiers, and some of my journeys to discover all types of slime. Hopefully this will aid you on your quest to master both toolmaking and the slimes in the world.</p>
