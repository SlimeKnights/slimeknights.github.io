While adding a compass to tools magnetizes the tool, just holding the compass near the tool has an interesting effect on modifiers. You can actually use the compass to rearrange modifiers without removing them from the tool! Unlike invisible ink, this has more applications than art, as it seems conflicts in modifiers is resolved by their position on the tool.</p>

I have discovered that it is possible to remove modifiers from tools using a wet sponge. if you don't happen to have one of those, spider venom is also effective. Removing the modifier gives me back space for new modifiers, but unfortunately the items used to apply the modifier are lost. At least I can reuse the sponge.</p>
