Using a piggybackpack on a mob lets you pick them up to ride you, perfect for when your pig gets tired on long journeys. They are also good for tossing monsters into your smeltery. I have successfully worn up to 3 piggybackpacks at one time, though it's hard to walk with so many riders.</p>

<p>Sharpening flint into a star shape creates a quite effective projectile weapon. While it's nowhere near as good as a bow, it still produces pretty good knockback and damage, which can help you escape from monsters.</p>
