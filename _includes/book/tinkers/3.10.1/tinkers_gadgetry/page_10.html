While not possible to preserve the modifier items, I have managed to store the essence of the modifier into a crystal while removing it, allowing reuse of the modifier. The process requires a slime crystal of the appropriate type and a wet sponge. This also works on enchanted tools as books if you use dragons breath and enderslime crystals.</p>

This discovery lead me to further experiment with other crystals and enchantments. It turns out that you can extract upgrade modifiers from enchanted books or tools using just skyslime crystals and lapis. The process seems a lot less stable than the enderslime method however, I have been unable to recover the tool.</p>
