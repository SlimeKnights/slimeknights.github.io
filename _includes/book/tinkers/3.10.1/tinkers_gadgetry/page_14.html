<p>Bones from wither skeletons seem to have unique properties compared to the bones of regular skeletons. Selena and Nemea have managed to create tools out of these, and Thruul has used them in some clever modifiers. I have been working on producing a powder similar to bonemeal as I want to see the effect bones infused with wither would have on plants</p>

<p>If you can hit the ender dragon with the force of an explosion, it may drop one of its scales. I was told the easiest way to do this is breaking an end crystal while it is healing the dragon, though TNT can also be effective. So far I have been unsuccessful in obtaining a scale, though once I do I have heard that Thruul has found a way to use them to make tools more powerful.</p>
