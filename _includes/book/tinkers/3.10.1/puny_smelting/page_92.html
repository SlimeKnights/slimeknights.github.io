There was just too much awesomeness to fit in a single book so I had to write a second book. After you have mastered the melter, go melt down some grout and pour it on a book to make the sequel.</p>

Apparently some aspiring tinkers don't have enough arms to make tools and hold both of my books. If you just had four arms like me it would not be a problem! Luckily for you nerds, for just a bit of molten gold you can craft Selena's new book, which has all the tool building info that need. Don't expect to find anything about my awesome smeltery in there.</p>
