    <p>Alright tinker, you've melted down some metal and figured out how to move it around. All that's left now is to turn it into some tool parts!</p>

<p id="sand-casts" class="underline large" style="align-self: center">Sand Casts</p><p>To cast your tool part: first craft a blank sand cast and use the interact button to put it into a casting table. Craft a tool part in the part builder and use it on the blank sand cast, then use it again to remove the part. You can then pour molten metal into the table and grab your part once it's cooled. The sand cast is used up in the process.</p>
<p>Non-blank sand casts will revert into blank sand casts when picked up.</p>
