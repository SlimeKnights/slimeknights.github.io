<span style="color: #000000">To cast your tool part: first craft a blank sand cast and use the interact button to put it into a casting table. Craft a tool part in the part builder and use it on the blank sand cast, then use it again to remove the part. You can then pour molten metal into the table and grab your part once it's cooled. The sand cast is used up in the process.</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Non-blank sand casts will revert into blank sand casts when picked up.</span>
