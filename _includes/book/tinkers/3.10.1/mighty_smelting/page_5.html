Alloying is a process that will allow you to combine your lesser materials into stronger, more powerful ones.</p>
<p>In order to alloy all you have to do is find two materials that can be alloyed together, put them in a fueled smeltery, and watch as they melt together to form a new stronger material.</p>
<p>Some materials may need hotter fuels in order to alloy.</p>
