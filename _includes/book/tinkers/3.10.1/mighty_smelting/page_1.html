So you survived this far fellow Tinker, perhaps you are smarter than I believed. Well then let's take that puny melter and those puny metals and make them even stronger. </p>
<p>I hope you are ready fellow Tinker, this is going to get really advanced really fast.</p></div><div class="right"><p id="tinker's_anvil" class="underline large" style="align-self: center">Tinker's Anvil</p>

Alright Tinker, it's time to put that puny Tinker Station away and create the mighty Tinker's Anvil. The ability to create the biggest and best tools is simply one hammer pound away.</p>
<p>This anvil can only be made with the finest of alloys, but will bring you the broadest of tools. They allow you to make the best modifiers, and let you rename tools during any modification.</p>
