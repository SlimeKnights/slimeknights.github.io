<p>Your smeltery must have a floor made of acceptable smeltery blocks excluding glass. Acceptable blocks will be showcased in a few pages! Your smeltery also must be rectangular, it can not be L shaped, circle shaped, or dodecahedron shaped.</p>
<p>The max size of your smeltery is 16x16x65 external, or 14x14x64 internal.</p>
