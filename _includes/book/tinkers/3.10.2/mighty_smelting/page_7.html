    <p>Tanks are good for storing molten fluids or fuels. If you want to melt metals in your smeltery you'll need one! Tanks can be filled from buckets, potions, and can also be poured into from the smeltery if you want to store stuff for later or cast without a smeltery.</p>
<p>Tanks cannot be used for the floor of the smeltery.</p>
