    <p>Skyslime geodes are found in caves near the surface, and rarely even I have seen one on the surface leading me to believe they might have origins in space. These geodes seem to promote growth of certain varieties of moss nearby.</p>

    <p>Earthslime geodes are located deep underground, and can be some of the largest geodes I have seen. You can often identify them by the presence of clay.</p>
