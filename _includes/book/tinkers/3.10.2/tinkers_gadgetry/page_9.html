    <p>Earthslime islands are sometimes found in the overworld oceans, appearing less alien than their skyslime cousins. They are not the only way to find the common green variant of slime, though the grass causes them to appear much more commonly.</p>

    <p>Clay islands are odd compared to the others as the islands appear more overworld than slime. These islands do sometimes produce an odd clay slime I have named "terracubes". They cannot jump very high, and seem bound to darkness like many other monsters in the overworld.</p>
