    <p>Ever wish you knew how much fluid was in a tank? Try a gauge! Gauges will tell you the amount of fluid inside a block when you interact with them.</p>
<p>Obsidian gauges will additionally show you the contained fluid in their window, though its not hard to look inside my tanks!</p>

<div class="column" style="padding-top: 80px">
    <p>Ever have too much molten metal and need something to do with it? Try the fluid cannon! On a redstone pulse, it shoots out contained fluid which might burn your enemies, destroy blocks, or automatically feed you!</p>
<p>Interacting with the bottom allows giving it an item stack to use with its fluid; with the right fluid type this can place blocks or use tools.</p>
