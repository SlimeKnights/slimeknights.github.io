    <p>The casting tank is ideal for automatically filling or emptying simple fluid containers such as buckets, bowls, or bottles. Works with hoppers, faucets, and channels.</p>
<p>Interacting with the top allows placing items inside, and interacting wit the bottom lets you place fluids. Does not work well with tools, the tinker tank may serve you better.</p>
