    <p>Did your friend give you a tool using inferior "enchanting"? Not a total waste of space. You can use enderslime crystals and dragon's breath to turn an enchantment on a tool or book into an upgrade modifier crystal. You can do this multiple times until you pulled each enchantment off that item.</p>

    <p>What, you haven't killed the ender dragon yet? Fine, you can use skyslime crystals and lapis lazuli to extract enchantments as well. This only works on upgrade modifiers and will destroy the tool or book after extracting the enchantment.</p>
