    <p>As you locate new materials, you may decide a modifier just isn't cutting it anymore. All you have to do to remove it is scrub it down with a wet sponge. Don't have sponges? Try some spider venom then. Removing the modifier gives you back its modifier slots, but the material you used to apply the modifier is lost forever. You can use the sponge again though.</p>

    <p>Wanted to move that modifier to another tool instead of removing it? Just use a wet sponge, and a crystal: skyslime for upgrades, earthslime for defense, ichor for abilities, amethyst for slotless, or enderslime for anything. Crystal will be filled with the essence of the modifier, which can be applied to another tool.</p>
