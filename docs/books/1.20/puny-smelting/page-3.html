<p id="melter.meltergui2" class="underline large" style="align-self: center">Operation</p><p>1: These 3 slots are where you put in what you want to melt. It may be ores, ingots, or anything else you feel like attempting to melt!</p>
<p>2: This is where your molten material will show. Remember that you may only have one molten material at a time in the melter.</p>
<p>3: This is where your fuel shows. If you have a heater it will appear as shown and you will be able to insert any item that can be used as fuel. If you have a seared tank it will show a bar with liquid fuel in it. Left clicking the bar with a fluid item will attempt to fill the item from the tank, while right clicking will attempt to dump the item into the tank.</p>
