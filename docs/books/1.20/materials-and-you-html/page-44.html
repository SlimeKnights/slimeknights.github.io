<div class="column" style="padding-top: 80px">
  <p>Upgrades are standard improvements to a tool. They are usually done by applying an item and 'rubbing off' some of its magic qualities, like redstone making tools faster. Most tools start with around 3 upgrade slots, though it's possible to get more slots through other types of modifiers.</p>
<p>Thruul M'Gon's Puny Smelting has a full list of upgrades available on tools, along with the Encyclopedia of Tinkering.</p>

<p id="modifiers.slotless" class="underline" style="align-self: center">Slotless Modifiers</p>
<div class="column" style="padding-top: 80px">
  <p>Slotless modifiers do not require slots, unlike all other types of modifiers. This typically means the modifier either has some tradeoff or the effect is minor. One notable type of slotless modifiers is bonus modifiers, which grant additional modifier slots. Many exist that grant more upgrade slots, and I am told some even exist to grant more ability slots.</p>
