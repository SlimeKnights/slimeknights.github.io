<p id="modifiers.traits" class="underline" style="align-self: center">Traits</p><p>Traits are inborne abilities related to the creation of the tool. They are brought out with superior quality, sympathetic magic, or by running enough energy into the tool that it starts exhibiting unusual properties.</p>
<p>There are two basic types of traits: material traits which come from the materials chosen for each part in the tool, and tool traits which are native to the type of tool crafted.</p>
<p>This book, along with Thruul M'Gon's Puny and Mighty Smelting and Nemea's Fantastic Foundry all cover a tier of materials with a listing of material traits. Tool traits are covered both by this book and Mighty Smelting.</p>
