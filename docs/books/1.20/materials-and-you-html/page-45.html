  <p>Abilities are powerful modifiers that drastically change a tool. Modifiers such as silky and autosmelt are notable as both change the effects of mining blocks, while dual wielding makes tools much easier to handle. Nearly all tools start with a single ability slot, and can only receive up to 2 more, so choose abilities wisely.</p>
<p>Thruul M'Gon's Mighty Smelting has a full list of abilities available on tools, along with the Encyclopedia of Tinkering.</p>

  <p>Defense are a type of modifier exclusive to armor, boosting protection against particular threats such as fire or knockback. They provide another way to customize armor as most armor types lack material traits. Typically, armor with a large number of defense slots start with fewer upgrade slots, meaning functionality is sacrificed for protection.</p>
