<p id="armor.info" class="underline" style="align-self: center">Armor Information</p><p>Armor can be created in a variety of forms. Some armor is created in the crafting station, some in the tinker station, and some is made by casting.</p>
<p>Armor have varying number of upgrade, defense, and ability slots based on the type; some types even have material traits.</p>
<p>Unlike tools, holding the armor typically provides no effect; most modifiers require wearing the armor to be applicable.</p>
