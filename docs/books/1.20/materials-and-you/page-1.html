    <p>Welcome to the third edition of Materials & You: Surviving the first day and beyond. Unlike the second
        edition,
        this book focuses in on tool crafting and tool types, and leaves topics such as modifiers to Further
        Reading.</p>
    <p>If you are wondering about the changes in the newest version, check the "What's New" page, linked from GitHub
        or
        on the SlimeKnights Discord. Sadly I couldn't figure out links so I can't link them to you</p>
