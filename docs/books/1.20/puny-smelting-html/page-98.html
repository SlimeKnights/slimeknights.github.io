<p>Wanted to move that modifier to another tool instead of removing it? Just use a wet sponge, and a crystal: skyslime for upgrades, earthslime for defense, ichor for abilities, amethyst for slotless, or enderslime for anything. Crystal will be filled with the essence of the modifier, which can be applied to another tool.</p>

<p>Did your friend give you a tool using inferior "enchanting"? Not a total waste of space. You can use enderslime crystals and dragon's breath to turn an enchantment on a tool or book into an upgrade modifier crystal. You can do this multiple times until you pulled each enchantment off that item.</p>
