<p>While normally compass magnetizes tools, you can instead use the magnet to reorder modifiers without removing them. Unlike invisible ink, this isn't just art; the order of modifiers on the tool allows you to change the order overlapping modifiers run. Placing the compass in the upper slot makes the modifier lower priority, while the lower slot makes it higher.</p>

<p>As you locate new materials, you may decide a modifier just isn't cutting it anymore. All you have to do to remove it is scrub it down with a wet sponge. Don't have sponges? Try some spider venom then. Removing the modifier gives you back its modifier slots, but the material you used to apply the modifier is lost forever. You can use the sponge again though.</p>
