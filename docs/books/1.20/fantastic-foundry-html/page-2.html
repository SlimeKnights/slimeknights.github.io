<p id="alloyer.alloy" class="underline large">Features</p><p>Since my foundry can't alloy I have created a solution for you that is simple to use.</p>
<ul class="prop-list">
<li>Requires a fuel tank or a heater, better fuel allows making better alloys</li>
<li>Takes input from tanks around the alloyer, adding more tanks gives you more metals to alloy with at once</li>
</ul>
