<div style="padding-top: 188px">
<p>These blood red islands are occasionally found in the lava oceans of the nether. They tend to have a higher concentration of magma cubes than the rest of the nether, and also include an odd variant of fungus that seems to be a source of ichor.</p>

<p id="exploration.enderslime_island" class="underline" style="align-self: center">Enderslime Islands</p>
<div style="padding-top: 188px">
<p>Enderslime islands can be found around the outer islands in the end as a breeding ground for enderslimes. I believe they were once the same as skyslimes, before their desire for exploration took them across dimensions. They sometimes are found with a metal they picked during their travels.</p>
