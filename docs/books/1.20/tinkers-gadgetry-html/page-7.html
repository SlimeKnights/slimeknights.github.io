  <p>Like steel shards, knightmetal shards are primarily obtained from slimes, though in this case its enderslimes with a knightmetal core. Similarly, they can be found in knightmetal geodes, again not regrowing after harvesting. These metal shards can also be located in the Twilight Forest, though to many the knowledge of reaching that dimension has become lost.</p>

<div class="column" style="padding-top: 80px">
  <p>If you can hit the ender dragon with the force of an explosion, it may drop one of its scales. I was told the easiest way to do this is breaking an end crystal while it is healing the dragon, though TNT can also be effective. So far I have been unsuccessful in obtaining a scale, though once I do I have heard that Thruul has found a way to use them to make tools more powerful.</p>
