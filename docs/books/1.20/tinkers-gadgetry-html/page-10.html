<div class="column" style="padding-top: 80px">
  <p>If you can hit the ender dragon with the force of an explosion, it may drop one of its scales. I was told the easiest way to do this is breaking an end crystal while it is healing the dragon, though TNT can also be effective. So far I have been unsuccessful in obtaining a scale, though once I do I have heard that Thruul has found a way to use them to make tools more powerful.</p>

<p id="exploration.skyslime_island" class="underline" style="align-self: center">Skyslime Islands</p>
<div style="padding-top: 196px">
<p>Skyslime islands can be found around the overworld floating above the terrain. Legend tells that skyslimes were invaders from another realm, though these days they are mostly found near skyslime grass. They appear to be experts in forging steel, which many tinkers fail to mimic.</p>
