<div style="padding-top: 190px">
<p>These blood red islands are occasionally found in the lava oceans of the nether. They tend to have a higher concentration of magma cubes than the rest of the nether, and also include an odd variant of fungus that seems to be a source of ichor.</p>

<p id="exploration.enderslime_island" class="underline ">Enderslime Islands</p>
<div style="padding-top: 190px">
<p>Enderslime islands can be found around the outer islands in the end as a breeding ground for enderslimes. I believe skyslimes and enderslimes were once the same before they came to our world, but living in their separate environments changed them.</p>
