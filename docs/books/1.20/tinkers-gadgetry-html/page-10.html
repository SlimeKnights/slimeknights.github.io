<div style="padding-top: 188px">
<p>Enderslime islands can be found around the outer islands in the end as a breeding ground for enderslimes. I believe they were once the same as skyslimes, before their desire for exploration took them across dimensions. They sometimes are found with a metal they picked during their travels.</p>

<div style="padding-top: 206px">
<p>Skyslime geodes are found in caves near the surface, and rarely even I have seen one on the surface leading me to believe they might have origins in space. These geodes seem to promote growth of certain varieties of moss nearby.</p>
