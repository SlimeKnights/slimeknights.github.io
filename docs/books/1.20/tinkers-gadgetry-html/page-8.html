<div class="column" style="padding-top: 80px">
  <p>If you can hit the ender dragon with the force of an explosion, it may drop one of its scales. I was told the easiest way to do this is breaking an end crystal while it is healing the dragon, though TNT can also be effective. So far I have been unsuccessful in obtaining a scale, though once I do I have heard that Thruul has found a way to use them to make tools more powerful.</p>

<p id="exploration.skyslime_island" class="underline ">Skyslime Islands</p>
<div style="padding-top: 198px">
<p>Skyslime islands can be found around the overworld floating above the terrain, and contain grass which is essential for skyslime breeding. Legend tells that skyslimes were invaders from another realm, though they are mostly confined to areas near the islands.</p>
