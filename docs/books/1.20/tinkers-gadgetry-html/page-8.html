<div style="padding-top: 196px">
<p>Skyslime islands can be found around the overworld floating above the terrain. Legend tells that skyslimes were invaders from another realm, though these days they are mostly found near skyslime grass. They appear to be experts in forging steel, which many tinkers fail to mimic.</p>

<div style="padding-top: 182px">
<p>Earthslime islands are sometimes found in the overworld oceans, appearing less alien than their skyslime cousins. They are not the only way to find the common green variant of slime, though the grass causes them to appear much more commonly.</p>
