<div class="column" style="padding-top: 80px">
  <p>Occasionally when exploring dungeons or nether fortresses, I have found slimy seeds in the chests. I am unsure of their origin, but planting them on either regular or slimy dirt produces slimy grass of the same quality as if you transplanted it from one of the islands. I have also seen slimy saplings in these chests, so it's possible you could get all the flora of the islands without ever visiting one.</p>

<div class="column" style="padding-top: 80px">
  <p>Bones from wither skeletons seem to have unique properties compared to the bones of regular skeletons. Selena and Nemea have managed to create tools out of these, and Thruul has used them in some clever modifiers. I have been working on producing a powder similar to bonemeal as I want to see the effect bones infused with wither would have on plants</p>
