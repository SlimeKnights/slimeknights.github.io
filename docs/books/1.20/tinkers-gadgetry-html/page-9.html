<div class="left">
<p id="exploration.clay_island" class="underline">Clay Islands</p>
<div style="padding-top: 188px">
<p>Clay islands are odd compared to the others as the islands appear more overworld than slime. These islands do sometimes produce an odd clay slime I have named "terracubes". They cannot jump very high, and seem bound to darkness like many other monsters in the overworld.</p>

<p id="exploration.blood_island" class="underline">Blood Islands</p>
<div style="padding-top: 188px">
<p>These blood red islands are occasionally found in the lava oceans of the nether. They tend to have a higher concentration of magma cubes than the rest of the nether, and also include an odd variant of fungus that seems to be a source of ichor.</p>
