  <p>Steel shards are dropped from uncommon skyslimes that have a steel core. They can also be found occasionally in skyslime geodes, though they will not regrow. Outside of shard form, steel can also be obtained as a byproduct of iron ore, though this will not let you recreate steel shards for weapons.</p>

<div class="column" style="padding-top: 80px">
  <p>Like steel shards, knightmetal shards are primarily obtained from slimes, though in this case its enderslimes with a knightmetal core. Similarly, they can be found in knightmetal geodes, again not regrowing after harvesting. These metal shards can also be located in the Twilight Forest, though to many the knowledge of reaching that dimension has become lost.</p>
