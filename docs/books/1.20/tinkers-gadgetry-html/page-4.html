<p>Making use of rarer metals, I have managed to create variants of item frames with unique properties.</p>

<p id="gadgets.fancy_frame_details" class="underline">Fancy Item Frames</p><ul class="prop-list">
<li>Clear: Turn invisible when an item is placed inside, and allow interacting with the block behind when filled and not sneaking.</li>
<li>Gold: Gradually rotates the item automatically. Crafting with a redstone torch reverses the direction.</li>
<li>Diamond: Gradually reduces the rotation until the item is upright.</li>
<li>Manyullyn: Always appears fully lit, even in darkness.</li>
<li>Netherite: Resistant to fire and explosions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Diamond, manyullyn, and netherite also support twice as many rotations as other frames.</p>
