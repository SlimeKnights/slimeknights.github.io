<div class="column" style="padding-top: 80px">
  <p>Bones from wither skeletons seem to have unique properties compared to the bones of regular skeletons. Selena and Nemea have managed to create tools out of these, and Thruul has used them in some clever modifiers. I have been working on producing a powder similar to bonemeal as I want to see the effect bones infused with wither would have on plants</p>

<p id="exploration.steel_shard" class="underline" style="align-self: center">Steel Shards</p>
<div class="column" style="padding-top: 80px">
  <p>Steel shards are dropped from uncommon skyslimes that have a steel core. They can also be found occasionally in skyslime geodes, though they will not regrow. Outside of shard form, steel can also be obtained as a byproduct of iron ore, though this will not let you recreate steel shards for weapons.</p>
