## Getting Started

To get started you need a few tables and a place to put your patterns. You can use [Just Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) to lookup recipes for the tables.

{% include update/image.html name="tables" alt="An overview of all the tables in the mod." %}

Be sure to put the pattern chest by the part builder, as you can access them together. Use the Stencil Table to craft the patterns, and craft tool parts from them using the Part Builder. The part builder also displays information about the material used.

{% include update/image.html name="part-builder" alt="UI for the part builder creating some tool parts." %}

Next step is the Tool Station, where  you build, modify, and repair tools like so.

{% include update/image.html name="tool-station" alt="UI for the tool station, crafting a tool." %}

## Smeltery

The next step is to build a Smeltery, so you can process metals and use them for tool parts as well. All you need is some gravel, sand and clay.

{% include update/image.html name="smeltery" alt="A full sized smeltery." %}
{% include update/image.html name="fluids" alt="Many fluid types in tanks." %}

You can even automate your Smeltery.

## World

The mod also brings a few new things to the world, including cobalt ore, and these fellows here.
