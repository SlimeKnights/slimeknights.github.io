#### Material textures

The textures for a tool parts are not typically created by hand. Rather, we create a gray scale version of the texture, then take advantage of texture generators to generate the variants. For information on using texture generators in a Java mod, see [Texture Generators](../texture-generators).

For information on using texture generators in a low code mod, see the [Generate Part Textures Command](/docs/commands/tinkers/generate-part-textures). For an example part texture JSON file, see [Tinkers' Things](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersThings/blob/1.20/src/assets/tinkers_things/tinkering/generator_part_textures.json).
