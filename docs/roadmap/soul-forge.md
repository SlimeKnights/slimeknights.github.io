title: Soul Forge

The soul forge is a multiblock made from all the dimensions. Allows advanced manipulation of traits and creation of unique materials.

{% include toc.html %}

## Soul Extractor

* Requires materials from ancient cities to build.
* Allows you to remove the soul from materials, granting hollow.
    * Hollow is a tier 4 material with pretty solid stats, but a hollow trait (+1 soul slot).
    * You can fill it with traits using the other parts of the soul forge, with some risk.
* Also allows creation of hollow gems. Hollow gems are inverted diamonds, reducing a variety of stats in exchange for +1 soul slot.

## Soul Infuser

* Requires materials from bastions to build.
* Allows you to add a soul to an existing material.
* Using alone only works with liquid soul, which can be infused into a few things including iron to make soulsteel.
    * Soulsteel is a tier 4 special material, with a trait that consumes your XP to mine faster and do more damage.

## Soul Movement

* Souls are axis aligned projectiles similar to shulker bullets
* The soul extractor shoots out a soul after extracting.
* Souls can hit "soul refractors" to be redirected down a different axis.
* Souls can also be split into multiple smaller souls if hitting the right block.
* Souls decay if they exist too long, or if they hit a block where they lack interactions.
* Refracting into soul forge blocks will continue the recipe.

## Soul Slots

* Combining the soul extractor and the soul infuser lets you fill soul slots on tools.
* Simply extract the relevant material soul then connect it into the infuser using some hollow wires to fill a tool.
* The first soul slot filled on a tool has no consequences.
* Every soul slot filled after the first also adds a random curse alongside the intended trait.
    * The curse is randomly chosen from a list, some will be relatively tame and some pretty horrible.
* Soul slots can be obtained in several ways:
    * Every tool can get a soul slot from a hollow gem, which reduces its stats.
    * Tools with materials can use hollow to get a soul slot.
    * Rebalanced can grant a soul slot.
    * Possibly include a 4th way that can be repeated for more curses.
* New way to add modifiers to tools, replacing embossments from 1.12.

## Soul Merger

* Combining multiple souls together allows creating "soul alloys" of sorts.
* This requires both hollow and soulsteel to construct.
* Used for many tier 4 and tier 5 materials.

## Soul Staff

* Originally, enderslime staffs were going to get 3 starting soul slots, however further consideration suggested a new staff was better suited.
    * The addition of the soul forge will lead to enderslime staffs starting with 1 soul slot.
* Crafted from a hollow gem, hollow ingots, and whatever in hollow seems most like wood.
* Starts with 2 upgrade slots, 2 ability slots, and 3 soul slots.

## Teantium Ore

* Unstable ore of the end
* Will explode if mined improperly
* To properly mine the ore, you need to use the melting modifier and obtain it as a liquid
* If casted into ingots, the ingots will explode after a short time
* To process the ore:
    * Place the teantium ingot in the soul forge, and extract the shaluth and soulsteel souls. This leaves behind hollow
    * Place the two souls back into separate hollow ingots to use
* Shaluth and soulsteel will be tier 4 materials used in alloys. Unstable may be used in other crafting recipes but cannot be used as a material

## Soul Splitter

* Crafted from materials found in the end.
* Required to process teantium into a usable form.
* Can also split alloys into their core components for recycling.
* Input is liquids instead of items

## Tool materials

* Soulsteel
    * Tier 4 melee material made from forcing a lot of liquid soul into an ingot.
    * Temporarily lowers the targets max health at the cost of consuming the attackers XP.
    * Can also ignore a portion of mined blocks's hardness.
    * If the attacker runs out of XP, their max health will lower.
* Hollow
    * Tier 4 special material made from removing the soul from metals.
    * Grants the tool 1 additional soul slot.
* Shaluth
   * Tier 4 material made from splitting teantium.
   * Trait will increase drops from mobs at the cost of damage.
* Ardite
   * Tier 4 material made from splitting teantium.
   * Trait will increase tool speed against all blocks (even ineffective) at the cost of loss of block drops (like blasting in 1.12).
* Gardite
    * Tier 5 gem made from ((((ardite + earthslime) + skyslime) + ichor) + enderslime) into a hollow gem in the soul forge.
* KnightSlime
    * Tier 5 composite, from pouring shaluth (possibly combined with other stuff) onto slimestone.
* Ebonite
    * Tier 5 weapon material made by forging the souls of blazing bone, venombone, and shaluth.
    * Charges as the player takes wither damage, then unleashes powerful effects based on the charge.
* Matthium
    * Tier 5 harvest material alloyed using soulsteel, ardite, hollow, and gaseous XP
    * Temporarily boosts mining speed after attacking, and boosts attack speed after mining.
* Alexandrite
    * Tier 5 special material made by forging the souls of diamond, emerald, and shaluth into an ender pearl.
* ????
    * Trait is raging (previously belonging to bloodbone) which increases tool damage at low player health.

## Modifiers
