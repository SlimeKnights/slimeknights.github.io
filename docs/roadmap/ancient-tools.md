Ancient tools will typically double the traits from each of their parts, and get a stronger effect from the rebalanced modifier.

## Overview

Generally, ancient tools have 2 materials, which are randomly selected during worldgen and cannot be changed.

When applying rebalanced to an ancient tool, the effect is doubled, granting the following choices:

* +2 upgrade slots.
* +2 defense slots.
* +2 soul slots.
* +1 ability slot.
* Extra level of the first two material traits.

All ancient tools can be randomly bought from the wandering trader as their "rare trade". Cost ranges between 6 and 32 emeralds based on the quality of the tool.
