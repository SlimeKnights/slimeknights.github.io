This page is about the JSON to make a material craftable. For the JSON to define the material, see [Material Format](../materials).
</div>

While a material can be made craftable in the part builder using just the material definition, other forms of crafting require adding recipes. Note that the name of recipes used to craft materials does not matter, as the material ID is specified in part of the recipe.
