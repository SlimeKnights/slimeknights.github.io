## Part Casting

There are two types of part casting recipes. The standard part casting recipes define casting a fluid into a casting table to produce a tool part or material item, which is covered on [Part Recipes](../parts#part-casting). Composite part casting recipes define casting a fluid on a tool part to change the material of the tool part, which is also covered on [Part Recipes](../parts#composite-casting). Both part casting and composite casting require associating a fluid with a material, which is defined on [Material Recipes](../materials#casting-and-composite).

## Potion Casting

Potion casting recipes define casting a potion on an item to produce a potion item. It notably is used to cast potions, splash potions, lingering potions, and tipped arrows.
