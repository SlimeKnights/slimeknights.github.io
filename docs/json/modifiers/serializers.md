<div class="hatnote" markdown=1>
This page is about defining modifiers using modifier serializers. For the modern modifier module system, see [Modifiers](..).
</div>

Modifiers can be defined either in code or in data packs. When defined in data packs, they are located under `data/<domain>/tinkering/modifiers/<name>.json` for the modifier with [Modifier ID](../basic-types#resource-location) `<domain>:<name>`.
