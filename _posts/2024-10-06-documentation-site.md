Welcome to the SlimeKnight's developer documentation. This site will contain documentation on information useful to addon developers, data pack authors, and modpack developers related to any of the SlimeKnights mods. This site will also be used in the future for visual changelogs.

This site is still under construction as there is a lot of content to document. If you are interested in helping out, you can create a pull request on [the site's repository](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/slimeknights.github.io). The site is primarily written in markdown using Jekyll, though it will require a bit of knowledge of using GitHub to contribute. We need to both migrate content from the old GitHub wiki over and create pages for new content added since that wiki was last updated. If you join [our discord](https://discord.com/invite/njGrvuh), KnightMiner can talk about how to organize the new content on the documentation site.
