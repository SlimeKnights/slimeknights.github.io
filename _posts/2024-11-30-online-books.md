We have been working hard to add content to the SlimeKnights' Documentation. One of the player oriented pieces of content available is the [online books](/docs/books), which contain galleries of book pages for browsing the book contents out of game. All books from SlimeKnights mods between 1.16.5 and 1.19.2 have been added to the site, and future books will be added as updates change them. This is made possible by the new [export book images](/docs/commands/mantle/#export-book-images) command added by fuj1n.

In addition, this site now includes many pages covering information for addon developers and modpack makers, which can be found under [Documentation](/docs). Some of these pages were migrated from the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct/wiki), though there are also many new pages and many updates for 1.19 changes to datapacks. A few of these pages are still incomplete, but will be added in the future.

Finally, the [FAQ](/faq), [Roadmap](/docs/roadmap) and [What's New](/docs/whats-new) have been migrated from the GitHub wiki. Mostly these just provide nicer URLs to link the pages, but they also have better formatting and have been organized a bit better.
